# Contributing to C-From-Scratch

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Philosophy

This is an educational repository. Contributions should:

1. **Maintain rigour** — No hand-waving. Proofs matter.
2. **Preserve clarity** — Beginner-friendly explanations
3. **Follow the method** — Math → Structs → Code

## What We Need

### High Priority
- Typo fixes and clarifications
- Additional exercises
- Test cases for edge conditions
- Translations (if you're fluent)

### Medium Priority
- Additional projects following the same methodology
- Improved diagrams and visualisations
- Platform-specific build instructions

### Discussions Welcome
- Alternative approaches to proofs
- Additional failure mode analysis
- Real-world war stories

## How to Contribute

### Simple Fixes
1. Fork the repository
2. Make your change
3. Submit a pull request with clear description

### Larger Changes
1. Open an issue first to discuss
2. Wait for feedback before investing time
3. Follow the existing style and structure

## Style Guidelines

### Markdown
- One sentence per line (easier diffs)
- Use ATX headers (`#`, `##`, etc.)
- Code blocks with language specifier

### C Code
- C99 standard
- `snake_case` for functions and variables
- `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*

### Commit Messages
- Present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- First line under 50 characters
- Reference issues when applicable

## Code of Conduct

Be kind. Be helpful. Assume good intent.

This is a learning environment. Questions are welcome, no matter how basic.

## Questions?

Open an issue with the "question" label.
